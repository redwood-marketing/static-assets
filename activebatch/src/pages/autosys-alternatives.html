title: "AutoSys Alternatives: Cost-Friendly Alternative to Broadcom AutoSys"
description: Discover AutoSys Alternatives with intelligent automation and no-code integrations. Compare features, pricing, and orchestration capabilities across top workload automation tools, including options for dynamic resource optimization.
faqs:
    Is AutoSys outdated?:
        AutoSys is still widely used, but many IT teams consider it outdated compared to modern workload automation tools. Originally built for on-premises environments, it requires significant manual scripting and has limited support for hybrid cloud, real-time orchestration and self-service capabilities. As enterprise needs shift toward scalable, API-driven platforms that support containerized workloads and dynamic provisioning, AutoSys may not meet current demands without extensive customization.
        

        Broadcom’s development pace and support model have also led organizations to explore AutoSys alternatives with broader cross-platform support, improved user interfaces and lower operational overhead. Many of these tools offer native integrations for AWS, Azure, SAP and VMware, along with low-code options for building and managing jobs. These key features help you streamline complex workflows, align with DevOps practices and support automation use cases across diverse IT environments.

    What is the difference between AutoSys and ActiveBatch?:
        AutoSys is a job scheduling tool from Broadcom that primarily supports on-premises environments with batch processing and scripting. Its architecture often relies on manual configurations and lacks out-of-the-box integrations for modern platforms like AWS, Azure and SaaS tools. AutoSys requires more effort to scale across hybrid cloud environments and doesn’t provide low-code options for job creation, making it more complex to adapt to dynamic IT operations or DevOps pipelines.
        

        ActiveBatch by Redwood, on the other hand, is a workload automation platform with broader cross-platform compatibility and support for drag-and-drop workflow design. It includes built-in connectors for ERP systems, file transfers and ETL tools across multi-cloud and on-premises environments. ActiveBatch emphasizes self-service, real-time orchestration and end-to-end process automation with dashboards and APIs that simplify provisioning, SLA management and job execution across diverse operating systems like Linux, Microsoft and Unix.

    What is workload automation software?:
        Workload automation software is used to schedule, trigger and manage a wide range of IT tasks across systems, applications and environments. It replaces manual scripting with centralized control over job scheduling, workflows and dependencies, helping teams coordinate complex processes across cloud, on-premises and hybrid infrastructures. These tools often include support for file transfers, batch processes, real-time job status alerts and SLA tracking.
        

        Modern platforms offer low-code or no-code user interfaces, making it easier to connect business applications, data pipelines and ERP systems without deep scripting knowledge. With built-in integrations for tools like SAP, Oracle and VMware, workload automation solutions help optimize process automation, reduce delays and support orchestration across cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. They’re designed to support scalability, cross-platform functionality and API-based automation for evolving IT environments.
