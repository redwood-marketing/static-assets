faqs:
    What is a service orchestration automation platform?:
        'According to Gartner, a Service Orchestration and Automation Platform (SOAP) is described as follows: “Service orchestration and automation platforms are essential for delivering business services through complex workloads. SOAPs unify workflow orchestration, workload automation and resource provisioning, extending across data pipelines and cloud-native architectures.”
        SOAPs adapt to use cases for application architectures, cloud-native infrastructure and data pipelines. Thus, they complement DevOps initiatives and integrate with toolchains to standardize digital business processes.
        Infrastructure and operations leaders (I&O leaders) can use SOAPs to design and implement business services with customer-focused agility, improving SLA outcomes and reducing operational costs.'

    What is the Gartner Magic Quadrant™?:
        '”A Magic Quadrant™ provides a graphical competitive positioning of four types of technology providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct:
        <ul>
        <li>Leaders execute well against their current vision and are well-positioned for tomorrow.</li>
        <li>Visionaries understand where the market is going or have a vision for changing market rules, but do not yet execute well.</li>
        <li>Niche Players focus successfully on a small segment or are unfocused and do not out-innovate or outperform others.</li>
        <li>Challengers execute well today or may dominate a large segment but do not demonstrate an understanding of market direction.”</li>
        </ul>
